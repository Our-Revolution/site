The Board shall take an active role in furthering the goals and purposes of the Corporation and Directors are encouraged and expected to be active advocates for the Corporation’s goals. The Board may delegate the management of the activities of the Corporation to any person or persons, or committee however composed, provided the activities and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction, and subject to the oversight, of the Board.</p>

					<p> <b>SECTION 5.02.	</b><i><b>Number of Directors; Qualifications. </i></b>The Board of Directors shall consist of not less than three (3) or more than thirteen (13) members.

A majority of the Board of Directors in office shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. If a meeting cannot be organized because a quorum has not attended, those present may adjourn the meeting from time to time until a quorum is present, when any business may be transacted that may have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. </p>

					<p> <b>SECTION 5.10.	</b><i><b>Action by Written Consent</i></b>. </p>

					<p><b>  SECTION 5.12.   </b><i><b>No</i></b><b> </b><i><b>Compensation. </i></b>The Corporation shall not pay any compensation to any director for services rendered to the Corporation as a director or as an officer, except that a director may be reimbursed for reasonable and customary expenses incurred in the performance of his or her duties to the Corporation, in reasonable amounts as approved by a majority of the entire Board of Directors. </p>

					<p> <b>SECTION 5.13.	</b><i><b>Attendance at Meetings</i></b>. If any director has four (4) or more absences from regular meetings (which may include an annual meeting) in any twelve-month period, such absences shall constitute a resignation from the Board of Directors by such director.</p>
